			<p>Phases:</p>
			<p>1. Virtual, open-source academy, just like Khan Academy, but updated to allow anyone to publish tutorials, learning materials. "We can learn from anyone." - "The more the merrier."</p>
			<p>2. Community online reimagined, an alternative to socials, I call this a Community Interface or short CI. Text is a primarly linear medium generally, so I propose making this as an MMORPG, since there is also inertia behind this design.</p>
			<p>3. Other: Everyone is included here! Many ideas, things, that help support this system, and ultimately choose which direction it goes in. - This category is for ideas such as, among infinite (Leonardo da Vinci: "Art is never finished, only abandoned."), a virtual parliament which I propose should have an interesting journey: Either get fired or find a way to run an MMORPG through inspiration rather than managing, a word which will be used in the full message to refer to the idea of controlling someone, of struggle, and of the greater good. The full message, or, transmission, you could say, offers more such "Other" ideas.</p>
			<p>This system answers the question of creating a system that is innovative and new, adaptive; Which accepts everyone's wishes, and which is safe in the only ways that something can be safe - Being truly long-lasting and answering your wishes - more than this safety I find, makes things rather unsafe and short-term ;D#==.</p>
