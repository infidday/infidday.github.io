			<p>Greetings, dears!</p>
			<p>D-Day offer!</p>
	        	</br> 
			<p>1. Establish a virtual open-source academy that the public can contribute to and where any ideas can all be discussed. The initial D-Day offer, which I'd created for Idol would have Yuko Yurei as head of this academy;</p>
			<p>2. Create an MMORPG Community Interface (CI), an alternative to socials, designed, as an environment, to be encouraging for fun, rather than primarily linear [as text always is] and trading your attention for profit - Here, [in the original proposal] I am [was] proposing lady Fuyo Cloverfield acting as president.</p>
			<p>3. In the long term, it is my hope that this Idol, or whoever applies this, be able to change the lives of at least 3 million trafficked children, freeing them and providing theem a new life.</p>
                        <p>4. I propose the creation of a virtual parliament, headed by someone who should get the title "Envoy. Diplomat. And head of domestic affairs." - the first such head of domestic affairs being the only one appointed, not voted on by guild leaders - of course, I am [was, during the initial proposal] talking about none other than the Internet-beloved Nanobites! - who also should get to appoint a board of advisors with seats in parliament. This parliament has to figure out a way to make the MMORPG work without what we might call "managing", making be by force, but rather by inspiring, with exceptions if parliament cannot come up with a case for defending allowing something that is otherwise illegal in court.</p>
                        <p>5. Maintain friendly relations with [initial proposal!] Phase Connect (I know! Sounds like a bummer! There's much nicer stuff that everyone can like though...), and open friendly relations with anyone. Fighting versus anything, K.O. style, isn't actually fun!
                        <p>6. This system should begin blurring the boundary between public and leadership in a very clever way, that being, folks can submit ideas (like this) and help expand Idol, or whoever applies these ideas, as far as the oil industry.</p>
                        <p>7. Promote through all of this, without needing to go "You must believe this!", believing in authenticity, cooperation, human beings, and Kami-sama. Essentially, it is my belief that Creation, the Universe, or however you want to call it, is a place that is actually fun, and beautiful. These ideas are all not trying to fix something, or change anyone - They are ways I've found you could make everyone's wants work perfectly while making a long-lasting and helpful to the rest of the world place, respecting the natural laws of the Universe. --- This is why you can't patent this system, also, even if you wanted, since the details, each, are incredibly important, for who loves that field and dream, yet you at the same time can't --- you can't patent ideas, Google tells us.</p>
		        </br>
                        <p>All of these ideas are possible. It is simply a question of whether you'd like them!</p>
