			<p>Greetings, dears!</p>
			<p>D-Day offer for Idol!</p>
	        	</br> 
			<p>1. Establish, with Yuko Yurei as head, a virtual open-source academy that the public can contribute to and where different ideas can all be discussed;</p>
			<p>2. Create an MMORPG Community Interface (CI), an alternative to socials, designed, as an environment, to be encouraging for fun, with lady Fuyo Cloverfield acting as president.</p>
			<p>3. In the long term, it is my hope that this Idol, or whoever applies this, be able to change the lives of at least 3 million trafficked children, freeing them and providing theem a new life.</p>
                        <p>4. I propose the creation of a virtual parliament, headed by someone who should get the title "Envoy. Diplomat. And head of domestic affairs." - the first such head of domestic affairs being the only one appointed, not voted on by guild leaders - of course, I am talking about none other than the Internet-beloved Nanobites! - who also should get to appoint a board of advisors with seats in parliament. This parliament has to figure out a way to make the MMORPG work without what we might call "managing", making be by force, but rather by inspiring, with exceptions if parliament cannot come up with a case for defending allowing something that is otherwise illegal in court.</p>
                        <p>5. Maintain friendly relations with Phase Connect (I know! Sounds like a bummer! There's much nicer stuff that everyone can like though...), and open friendly relations with anyone. Fighting versus anything, K.O. style, isn't actually fun!
                        <p>6. This system should begin blurring the boundary between public and leadership in a very clever way, that being, folks can submit ideas (like this) and help expand Idol, or whoever applies these ideas, as far as the oil industry.</p>
                        <p>7. Promote through all of this, without needing to go "You must believe this!", believing in authenticity, cooperation, human beings, and Kami-sama. Essentially, it is my belief that Creation, the Universe, or however you want to call it, is a place that is actually fun, and beautiful. These ideas are all not trying to fix something, or change anyone - They are ways I've found you could make everyone's wants work perfectly respecting the natural laws of the Universe - this reliance on natural law (e.g. the principle of change - which naturally works as uniqueness and freedom) being also why this system cannot be patented, and why I share this freely with you.</p>
		        </br>
                        <p>All of these ideas are possible. It is simply a question of whether you'd like them!</p>
			<p>The only goal of this D-Day is to attempt to speak to someone with a 'leading' position and have at least a few reasons as to why refuse.</p>
