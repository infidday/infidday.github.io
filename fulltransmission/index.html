			<h2 class = "center">1. Community Learning</h2>
			<p>Few folks know that there were 2 D-Days in WW2, one in Southern Italy and one in Normandy, France. Thus, I call this D-Day 2024!</p>
			<p>This line above happens to be an example of a style we might experiment with in teaching. The idea is that teachers, in schools, or the virtual [placeholder name] Infinitia Academy in the MMORPG can freely look at the courses offered, and the materials offered (courses are collections of materials that folks have decided could go together), and choose ones to use.</p>
			<p>Before getting on how this fulfills the dreams of contemporary education, we have to note that this is done through hearts. The assumption is that with the other two pillars of this system unless the people really choose to take this off the rails, the rails of this system are designed to make it easy to be authentic, happy, and to make giving neat, as we'll discuss later, in the third chapter of this page.</p>
			<p>And yes, this fulfills a lot of the dreams of contemporary education, and fact-finding that doesn't destroy your life or make someone "the evil we must remove".</p>
			</br>

			<h2 class = "center">2. Community Interfaces - Adventure Style</h2>
			<p>I have come to the conclusion that adventure, authenticity, and friendship are not three different things.</p>
			<p>As part of our part I, let's discuss one interesting case, when folks believe that life is a struggle. For example, and I have seen many such cases of folks, a woman that enters a relationship on the premise of taking care of others, when she reallly wants to be taken care of.</p>
			<p>She will likely convince herself, somehow, that to live you need to be tough and force yourself to do something (which is wholly unnecessary in the first place.</p>
			<p>Not helping her, she is likely to marry someone who is also very dishonest, say a man that really wants to be in a polygamous relationship, because of the excitement of learning and committing his energy to more people, or because he is looking for approval (usually through sex) from the women, but he decides to stay in a monogamous relationship, the prefix 'mono-' meaning "one" or "single" + 'gamous', γάμος - marriage in Greek - so one marriage, rather than 'poly-', meaning "more".</p>
			<p>He is thus likely to have at least one relationship with a friend that's way closer than friends, though perhaps not sex, as that would seemingly contradict marriage, and probably be away from home a lot, save for when his wife's back "goes out" (those of you that understand illness will get this one very quickly), and she needs help with the chores, and who will also probably receive some of her annoyance.</p>
			<p>The wife is likely to in this scenario be the "problem person" in the family.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Add in kids, most of all if it's a girl in this relationship, and you've got an either codependent or narcissistic child!</p>
			<p>This is because in such relationships between a parent and child, the parent may attempt to make the child do the same things they're doing so they are "tough" and can "get through life".</p>
			<p>As you can see, inauthenticity and trying to just "fight" and "struggle" your way isn't as easy as it is made out to be. We have a tendency of always putting honesty and doing what you feel like doing - not talking about going to a bar generally, but more like "putting a lot of effort into a game", which is a great way to phrase the whole essence of this system -</p>
			<p>- We tend to put them on trial - but perhaps this might not be it...</p>
			</br>
			<p>In our example if the child refuses to do what the parent says (and otherwise just decides outside is the ruler, there's usually no third option without a great teacher or some change), the parent is likely to get threatened, at this point subconsciously rather than consciously since they've tried to forget what they wanted, and the child is trying to make it an option, which would make their whole life meaningless!</p>
			<p>This is rarely a conscious process by someone, but the parent typically then calls the child "greedy" or "selfish".</p>
			<p>A child without primary attachment figures it can rely on is likely to become solely self-reliant, and potentially, solely self-centered, no-questions, just like the parents!</p>
			<p>We call this kind of fear resulting in attempts to always control others, always, as that is the core of the word, often mixed with hidden (or sometimes up-front) self-dislike, narcissism!</p>
			</br>
			<p>To give you a brief example and make this pragmatic (that's always worth doing in these cases) (so you have a few instruments in case you wonder if you're a narcissist, as I did), picture an example a schoolteacher gave our class when presenting bullies.</p>
			<p>Someone that looks in the mirror, in the morning, and feels awful about their life, and yet and yet, when they go to school and call someone stinky - like, in a really mean way, as in "You dimwit! You smell like an old fart! No wonder you're from the countryside!" or stupid, example: Yo'! Stupid! - again, notice the trend of desensitizing from someone in some way and narrowing what someone is to one matter only ---</p>
			<p>Yes...</p>
			<p>This is when they grow a crown of gold, and seven flowers on top!</p>
			<p>Not my wording, though it's definitely an epic wording I 100% say "Yes." to.</p>
			</br>
			<p>The astute among you may mention that everyone has tendencies we might call "narcisstic", and some of you that are astute in psychology will recognize that this has all the characteristics to be described as an emotion!</p>
			<p>Yes. Of course!</p>
			<p>We usually just use the names anger and pride for this one.</p>
			<p>This is what I previously referred to as "control". Adolf Hitler wrote a book called "Mein Kampf", "My Struggle", for example, to illustrate our previous point about seeing life as a struggle, in this case where the superior race(s) need to win out over the inferior, and where the strong must destroy the weak or be "annihilated" [Adolf Hitler: "It appears the German people were not up to the task I put them up to [...] in which case they will be annihilated by the superior Eastern race].</p>
			</br>
			<p>This should give you a taste also of the kind of learning we can do together, and is an amazing illustration and example of my trust in that folks can do well being honest, that humans are not worthless sinners by default, and that we can work together!</p>
			</br>
			<p>All clear? [Seriously, I accept all questions, see informationinfinity13@gmail.com].
			</br>
			<p>It would be very delightful if you could feel trust, a big sign of which is gratitude, and a big result of which is grace, with this MMORPG *interface* (this is not a dead system, it requires you to exist! [As do all and any systems.]</p>
			<p>I just realized there's one more thing to note about this, for this letter I have differentiated between control and responsability, though you will not find this differentiation in the language in other places. This is notable, since I truly admire excitement and the choice made born of adventuring, and to adventure. I am not anti-responsability, basically.</p> <!-- TODO Check! -->
			</br>

			<h2 class = "center">3. Other</h2>
			<p>Before continuing I decided I'd like to give you a little surprise. How would it bear to you if it happened that I am actually 17 in 18 to 19 days?</p>
			<p>Yes, that's a nice three consecutive numbers! 17, 18, and 19!</p>
			<p>This should illustrate the belief I have in everyone['s ideas].</p>
			<p>-&gt You have already read one such idea, the idea of a virtual parliament whose aim is to figure out a way to run an MMORPG with no moderation team.</p>
			</br>
			<p>-&gt I have thought, for the virtual YouTubing, of "Who could make this system work..." - designing it for Idol, I figured it can have Yuko Yurei as head of this academy, lady Fuyo Cloverfield as honorary president for the aforementioned MMORPG - the people have called for her as CEO, but we'll get there - and I propose Nanobites, which everyone likes, and which I believe is the best for the job (and maybe the only one), as virtual parliament "Envoy. Diplomat. And head of domestic affairs"!</p>
			<p>In other areas, I find that sir Aviel, who acts as present CEO of Idol, appears to be a fatherly man, reminding me of a Sufi spiritual teacher I watched for some time.</p>
			<p>In this first scenario of applying this whole model, details, I would also, if there are interests taking money from Idol, I intend to not cut out their funding compeltely and gradually decrease it, with some added policies such as the maintaining of some funds for a longer time, if such an entity, if it even exists, is capable of supplying some pictures and documentation of their activities.</p>
			<p>I would only cut funds if I were to find out in some way that the money may be going to child trafficking, or other forms of hate, manipulation, and other matters I am clearly not biased for.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Two alternative scenarios I have thought of so far are one where Phase Connect applies this, though I haven't thought this one out a lot, and a secret, easter egg, scenario, where the two eventually merge, after a period of great cooperation.</p>
			</br>
			<p>We will now return to discussing more ideas, though, the last one you may call: "How do you actually make this happen?", "Where?", and "How?"</p>
			<p>One more note, I would advocate in such a position for full treatment of anyone wonderfully not merely based on if they have made mistakes or not, but even if they have.</p>
			<p>For example, I have full confidence in Hillary ;D as a great woman - even if she did worship Molok, as a leaked email suggests, I've heard, I believe in her.</p>
			<p>This can appear as a rather dangerous policy to take, however I have found it rather freeing.</p>
			<p>This is rather paradoxal...</p>
			<p>What's right!? What's wrong?! [Note: I am not implying child abuse, etc. is a fine deal, as we will see later on in this series of ideas.]</p>
			</br>
			<p>-&gt I propose trips!</p>
			<p>Yet again, around virtual YouTubing, which I super admire! - I believe a nice idea would be a Journey Across Romania, I could supply the locations, and I could contact an old friend in Hungary if someone wants a tour guide in Hungary!</p>
			<p>I can also give vlogging tips, they're simple: "Stop editing! Just film!"</p>
			<p>I would love to see such series with guests, and locations, like a certain village I love that's an [Easter Egg] in Romania.</p>
			<p>No tour guide will tell you about it. I found it while trying out wandering through the countryside [of course, I'd say you get someone as a guard for such an expedition, or "convince" the Romanian government to let you bring weapons. #nojihad)</p>
			</br>
			<p>-&gt Such a system would help not only virtual YouTubing, and the Internet, and adults, and children, but also those folks of the world that deal with true injustice, feeling like they can do nothing - we can help rescue them faster.</p>
			<p>Our previous MMORPG is an SAO-like MMORPG because it provides actual value - it could change your financial and legal status - and free folks can then, with more time create culture, learning, and - help people.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Capippalism is a great idea, but it's execution has not so far gone this far just because - well - no one proposed it so far -</p>
			<p>If you are wondering, at this point, yes, this system is built on universal laws, it is not just created to fix something, if you look at the bigger picture.</p>
			<p>- But, the fixing, the helping of folks, is a very important picture to look at.</p>
			<p>I can imagine a great tactic to motivate folks, speaking of virtual YouTubing's lovely Pippa, which is based on the true fact that you could be a child's hero.</p>
			<p>You may call me strange, but I get the job done - I've helped several folks who most people would discard as freeloaders, or other names, and found that they still had it in them to restart their lives.</p>
			<p>They just needed the right tools, and interest.</p>
			</br>
			<p>I think the interest part of charity is one we can sometimes forget about, it really does pay a big dividend, and I am a fan of more ways of changing your life.</p>
			<p>"You deserve it" and "Rising to the challenge" aren't exactly contemporary, and they might not be there for everyone. ---</p>
			<p>Instead, I propose a variety of motivations, and dreams, as something that can stand together if everyone just agrees that they don't want to be bound and isolated for eternity [pretty common human wish]! - I am not saying temporary reduction in connection with others to focus on how many letters you can fit in the circle, rather than the amount of circles and connections in probability theory is bad either ;D.</p>
			<p>All of this is a long way to introduce the idea that I want everyone to contribute their ideas freely!</p>
			<p>For example, someone like your dear child here, knows a lot about the oil industry, and wants us to fund them (US funding coups in Africa style) - I fund them after evaluating the matter!</p>
			</br>
			<p>It's simple! And if it doesn't work everyone dies, that's the worst. The end!</p>
			<p>Fine, total annihilation is the worst, you have it there. The e n d!</p>
			<p>One more note, this system doesn't actually force anyone in any industry to change their content, or change their views about the world, or adhere to an ideology.</p>
			<p>I just tried to remove the things that may cause distrust and harm - not even remove really, just create a framework for not being affected by what these have typically enthailed, and then restated that in a convenient way.</p>
			<p>I do this since I love the Internet, and I love virtual YouTubing, with it's having inspired me when literally 0 things worked, 24/7, and I wondered, being tired enough in the sense of not having courage that I could not go and [true story] try and commit suicide, so I wondered, wouldn't it be neat if everyone just hurt each other?</p>
			<p>At least it'd feel nice eventually to live like such and that?</p>
			</br>

			<h2 class = "center">End</h2>
			<p>[END] At last, "why do you actually do this?"</p>
			<p>"The part about doing this thing publically in this way?"</p>
			<p>It was taught to me that when someone helps you, trying to help, no matter their social role or position, is 1. what I want to do; 2. Fine.</p>
			<p>I was taught that we don't live in a world of alliances, and alliance shifts (that would be such a good title for a negative video: "The Alliance Shift (It's Time to Let It Go)").
			<p>I believe in a world where there is something, something you can't measure with money or power or even rightness.</p>
			<p>I offer you that on one of my hands, thus, and on the other, whatever you want.</p>
			</br>
			<p>And so, as the hour nears midnight, the entrance to Children's Day, June 1st.</p>
			<p>For the children of the world; Believing in them, that someone that inspired me, and the world.</p>
			<p>In a scene that might remind you of the times of Lazar and Milos in a country just next by that I've loved for a long time, Serbia.</p>
			<p>There would be no pulling back after doing this. "Are you sure?"</p>
			</br>
			<p>...</p>
			<p>"Yes. I am."</p>
			<p>Endless reasons, opportunities came to mind for the world. When we work together we can [...] [...]</p>
			</br>
			<p>"Shh..."</p>
			<p>"It's all fine."</p>
			</br>
			<p>So, I put on old songs I knew, like https://youtu.be/xAd6k0JFPDY?si=bHg3xiKxKHM_C9BA. And I ventured on.</p>
			<p>It was admittedly a little event, but that made it no less or more significant.</p>
			</br>
			<p>“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” ― Henry (Ford). This may not be a finalized saying, that tells you everything you could ever need, yet it is one that is so epic!</p>
